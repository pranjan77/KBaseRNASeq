parameters :
    sampleset_id :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Sample or Sample Set
        short-hint : |
            Select the RNA-seq read sample set associated with the RNA-seq experiment. Alternatively, if you have only one sample of RNA-seq reads, select the corresponding library object.
    bowtie_index :
        ui-name : |
            Indexed Genome
        short-hint : |
            Select the indexed genome built using Bowtie2
    read_mismatches :
        ui-name : |
            Read Mismatch Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many mismatches are discarded.
    read_gap_length :
        ui-name : |
            Read Gap Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many gaps are discarded.
    read_edit_dist :
        ui-name : |
            Read Edit Cutoff
        short-hint : |
            Final read alignments with more than this many edits are discarded.
    min_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will ignore donor/acceptor pairs closer than this many bases apart.
    max_intron_length :
        ui-name : |
            Maximum Intron Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will ignore donor/acceptor pairs farther than this many bases apart.
    min_anchor_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Anchor Length
        short-hint : |
            TopHat will report junctions spanned by reads with at least this many bases on each side of the junction. This must be at least 3 and the default is 8.
    num_threads :
        ui-name : |
            Number of Threads
        short-hint : |
            Number of computational threads to align reads.
    report_secondary_alignments :
        ui-name : |
            Report Secondary Alignments
        short-hint : |
            Use this option to output secondary alignments.
    no_coverage_search :
        ui-name : |
            No Coverage Search
        short-hint : |
            Use this option to disable the coverage-based search for junctions.
    library_type :
        ui-name : |
            Library Type
        short-hint : |
            Select the direction of the reads with respect to the original mRNA when the library was prepared. The default is fr-unstranded.
    preset_options :
        ui-name : |
            Bowtie2 Alignment Preset Options
        short-hint : |
            Select the preset options to Bowtie2 for how reads are mapped. 
        long-hint : |
            Faster option is generally less sensitive and vice versa.
description : |
    <p>This method aligns the sequencing reads for a set of two or more samples to an eukaryotic genome using TopHat in order to identify splice junctions between exons with the help of Bowtie2 mapping program. Alternatively, if the user has only a single sample of reads, this method will take single-end or paired-end library object instead of a sample set.</p>
    <p>This method also takes a Bowtie2 indexed genome and outputs a set of read alignments in BAM format.</p>
    <p>In addition, it provides the alignment statistics such as total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in a table format.</p>
    
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone for one or more samples.</p>
