parameters :
  alignmentset_id :
    ui-name : |
        RNA-seq Alignment or Alignment Set 
    short-hint : |
        Select the RNA-seq alignment or alignment set created by HISAT2, TopHat2 or Bowtie2.
  num_threads :
    ui-name : |
      Number of  Threads
    short-hint : |
      Number of computational threads to assemble transcriptomes. The default is 2.
  label :
    ui-name : |
      Label
    short-hint : |
      Set label as the prefix for the name of the output transcripts
  min_isoform_abundance :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Isoform Abundance
    short-hint : |
      Set the minimum isoform abundance of the predicted transcripts as a fraction of the most abundant transcript assembled at a given locus. Lower abundance transcripts are often artifacts of incompletely spliced precursors of processed transcripts. Default: 0.1. 
  a_juncs :
    ui-name : |
      Filter Junctions 
    short-hint : |
      Junctions that don't have spliced reads that align across them with at least this amount of bases on both sides are filtered out. Default is 10.
  min_length :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Length
    short-hint : |      
      Select minimum length for predicted transcripts. Default is 200.
  j_min_reads :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Spliced Reads
    short-hint : |
      Select minimum spliced reads to align across a junction. Default is 1.
  c_min_read_coverage :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Read Coverage
    short-hint : |
      Select minimum read coverage allowed for predicted transcripts. Default is 2.5
  gap_sep_value :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum locus Gap
    short-hint : |
      Select minimum locus gap separation value. Default is 50.
  disable_trimming :
    ui-name : |
      Disable Trimming
    short-hint : |
      Disable trimming at the ends of the assembled transcripts.
  ballgown_mode :
    ui-name : |
      Enable Ballgown Input Table Files
    short-hint : |
      With this option StringTie can be used as a direct replacement of the tablemaker program included with the Ballgown distribution. 
  skip_reads_with_no_ref :
    ui-name : |
      Skip Reads 
    short-hint : |
      Skip Reads with no reference transcript.
  merge :
    ui-name : |
      Transcript merge mode
    short-hint : |
      Transcript merge mode.                                                    
    
description : |
    <p>This method assembles transcripts for a given sample or a sample set using StringTie so that you can view the relative abundances of the assembled transcripts in a histogram. </p>
    <p>STringTie is a successor of Cufflinks that is faster and provides more accurate reconstruction of genes and expression level. It accepts aligned RNA-seq reads from HISAT2, TopHat2 or Bowtie2 and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts. It then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how many reads support each one, taking into account biases in library preparation protocols.</p>
    <p>The StringTie output object contains GTF and FPKM files. The GTF file contains annotated transcripts assembled by StringTie whereas the FPKM file gives the normalized abundance of each transcript expressed in fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) and transcripts per kilobase million (TPM). The StringTie Table Histogram tab displays the abundance of normalized gene expression value in both log2(FPKM+1) and log2(TPM+1).</p>
