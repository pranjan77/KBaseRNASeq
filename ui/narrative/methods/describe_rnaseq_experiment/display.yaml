parameters :
    sampleset_id :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Sample Set
        short-hint : |
            Name of the output RNA-seq sample set object.
    sampleset_desc :
        ui-name : |
            Sample Set Description
        short-hint : |
            The detailed description of the RNA-seq samples selected
    platform :
        ui-name : |
            Platform
        short-hint : |
            The platform used for sequencing (e.g Illumina)
    Library_type :
        ui-name : |
            Library Type
        short-hint : |
            The type of sequencing reads - single-end vs. paired-end 
    condition:
        ui-name : |
            Treatment Labels
        short-hint : |
            Short label for each sample in the RNA-seq experiment. The treatment labels must be added in the same order as the reads. All replicates for the same treatment must have same label.
    sample_ids:
        ui-name : |
            Reads (Single-end/Paired-end)
        short-hint : |
            Select the single-end or paired-end reads files based on the type of sequencing reads.
    domain :
        ui-name : |
            Domain 
        short-hint : |
            The domain of the genome - prokaryotes vs. eukaryotes
    source :
        ui-name : |
            Source
        short-hint : |
            The source of the data used for RNA-seq experiment (e.g NCBI)
    publication_id:
        ui-name : |
            Publication Details 
        short-hint : |
            The publication details of the data used for RNA-seq experiment

description : |
    <p>This method allows the users to provide the metadata for a set of single-end or paired-end read files to set up an RNA-seq experiment. Note that the user must provide reads for two or more samples.</p>
    
    <p>Users need to import single-end or paired-end read files to the Data Pane before starting this method.</p>
    
    <p>It is mandatory for users to provide "RNA-seq Sample Set" (RNA-seq sample set object name), select the "Library Type",  "Reads" name for the selected library type, "Treatment Labels" and "Domain" from the drop down menu. The number of replicates must be same for each sample.</p>
    
    <p>Users can optionally fill in additional metadata information in the advanced options.</p>
   
    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a> and is not intended to run standalone.</p>
