parameters :
  expressionset_id :
    ui-name : |
      RNA-seq Expression Set
    short-hint : |
      Select the RNA-seq expression set associated with transcripts assembled by Cufflinks.
  output_obj_name :
    ui-name : |
      Cuffdiff Output
    short-hint : |
      Provide the name of Cuffdiff output
  num_threads :
    ui-name : |
      Number of Threads
    short-hint : |
      Number of  computational threads to align reads. The default is 2.
  min_alignment_count :
    ui-name : |
      Minimum Alignments
    short-hint : |
      The minimum number of fragment alignments in a locus needed for a significance test on changes in that locus observed between samples. The default is 10. 
  time_series :
    ui-name : |
      Time Series
    short-hint : |
       Analyze the provided samples as a time series, rather than testing for differences between all pairs of samples. 
  multi_read_correct :
    ui-name : |
      Multi Read Correct
    short-hint : |
      Do an initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads mapping to multiple locations in the genome. 
  labels  :
    ui-name : |
      Treatment Labels
    short-hint : |
      Specify a label for each sample that will be included in various Cuffdiff output files.
  library_type  :
    ui-name : |
      Library Types
    short-hint : |
      Select the direction of the reads with respect to the original mRNA when the library was prepared. The default is Standard Illumina.
  library_norm_method :
    ui-name : |
      Library Normalization Method
    short-hint : |
      Select how library sizes (sequencing depths) are normalized in Cufflinks and Cuffdiff. By default, no scaling is applied to FPKM.

description : |
    <p>This method uses the Cufflinks transcripts for two or more samples to calculate gene and transcript levels in more than one condition and finds significant changes in the expression levels.</p>
    <p>Internally, it uses Cuffmerge to merge multiple Cufflinks generated annotation files. If more than two BAM files are provided, Cuffdiff tests for differential expression between all pairs of samples.</p> 
    
    <p>Cuffdiff calculates the FPKM value of each transcript, primary transcript and gene in each sample and produces a number of output files zipped in Cuffdiff output object.</p>
    <p>The Cuffdiff output can be further analyzed and visualized using methods such as 'Create Expression Matrix from Cuffdiff' and 'View CummeRbund Plots'.</p> 

    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a> and is not intended to run standalone.</p>
