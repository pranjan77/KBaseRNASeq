description : |
    <p>This method uses the transcripts for two or more samples obtained from either Cufflinks or StringTie to calculate gene and transcript levels in more than one condition and finds significant changes in the expression levels.</p>
    
    
    <p>Ballgown calculates the FPKM or TPM value of each transcript, primary transcript and gene in each sample and produces a number of output files zipped in Ballgown output object.</p>
    
    <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a> and is not intended to run standalone.</p>
